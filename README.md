SvN(Signal V Noise) was a popular blog site where blogs on design, business, and tech were regularly posted till 2021 from various authors. It was designed by the the makers (and friends) of Basecamp. The page https://m.signalvnoise.com/search/ provides month wise blog posts from February 2021 to November 2013. In this project, we will retrieve information from this page using web_scraping: the process of extracting information from a website in an automated fashion using code. We will use Requests and BeautifulSoup to scrap data from this page. The outline of this project is listed below:
- Download the webpage using requests
- Parse the HTML source code using beautiful soup
- Extract Blog name, author name, published date and blog URLs from this page
- Compile extracted information using Python lists
- Save the extracted information to a CSV file.
